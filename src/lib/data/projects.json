        "description": "This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution to automatically detect blood vessels in retinal images. The ability to identify blood vessels is crucial for diagnosing various eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. By leveraging TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, the project aims to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to efficiently and accurately segment blood vessels from retinal images. By automating the process of blood vessel detection in retinal images, this project aims to aid in the timely diagnosis of eye diseases and reduce the workload of healthcare professionals."
